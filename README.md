My name is Eric L. Johnson and I have 10 years of programming experience in Real-Time Embedded Systems with 4 years additional experience at NASA KSC. I am just starting to learn Python and 
and plan to freelance after learning it in addition to learning how to code Artificial Intellignece in Python as well.  I shall post examples of my work here so that I can get hired doing 
Python programming projects. I can be contacted at procoder98765@gmail.com or 321-467-4158.
